# Autonomous Database(ADB)

An Autonomous Database allows us to very easily scale both OCPUs and storage independently of one another, we can also set the system up to automatically scale up three times the base limit.

For example â€“ If we increase the OCPU count to 11 and if the auto scaling is enabled so in that case when needed it can go up to 33 OCPUs.

An Autonomous Database in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a cloud-based database service that automates key database management tasks using machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

Oracle Autonomous Database on OCI simplifies database management by automating routine tasks, enhancing security, ensuring high performance, and providing scalability.

Here's a detailed overview of its features and benefits:

## Key Features

### Self-Driving
