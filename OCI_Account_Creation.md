**Cloud Account Name: Tenancy Name(Used to login into Oracle Cloud)** – Always ask the client which account name they want(because they might use it as a tag for their billings)

**Home Region** : We can select any Region because the billing structure is same for all regions[**Preference – US EAST (Ashburn)**]
