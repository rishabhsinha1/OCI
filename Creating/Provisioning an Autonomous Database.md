# Autonomous Database(ADB)

An Autonomous Database allows us to very easily scale both OCPUs and storage independently of one another, we can also set the system up to automatically scale up three times the base limit.

For example â€“ If we increase the OCPU count to 11 and if the auto scaling is enabled so in that case when needed it can go up to 33 OCPUs.

An Autonomous Database in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a cloud-based database service that automates key database management tasks using machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

Oracle Autonomous Database on OCI simplifies database management by automating routine tasks, enhancing security, ensuring high performance, and providing scalability.

Here's a detailed overview of its features and benefits:

## Key Features

### Self-Driving

 Automates database tuning, patching, updating, and security, freeing up database administrators (DBAs) from routine maintenance tasks.

### Self-Securing 

Automatically protects against both external attacks and malicious internal users. It applies security updates with no downtime and encrypts all data by default.

### Self-Repairing

Provides automated protection from downtime, including performing automatic backups and applying necessary patches.

## Types of Autonomous Databases

### Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP)

Optimized for transactional workloads, such as online transaction processing (OLTP) applications. It is designed to handle a high volume of transactions and offers high performance for transactional applications.

### Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)

Optimized for analytical workloads. It provides high performance for complex queries and analytics, making it suitable for data warehousing and business intelligence applications.

## Benefits

### Cost Efficiency

Reduces the cost of database management through automation, lowering the need for manual intervention and the risk of human error.

### Scalability

Offers flexible scaling options, allowing users to adjust compute and storage resources independently based on their workload demands.

### Performance

Provides high performance with features like automatic indexing and adaptive query optimization.

### Security

Ensures data security with always-on encryption, automated threat detection, and comprehensive auditing.

### High Availability

Offers built-in high availability and disaster recovery options, ensuring minimal downtime and business continuity.

## Use Cases

### Transactional Applications

For applications requiring fast and reliable transaction processing, such as e-commerce platforms, financial systems, and online booking systems.

### Data Warehousing and Analytics

For organizations needing robust data analytics, business intelligence, and reporting capabilities.

### Development and Testing

For development teams needing quick and easy access to a database environment for application development and testing purposes.

### Mixed Workloads

Capable of handling both transactional and analytical workloads within the same database instance.

## Working

### Provisioning

Users can quickly provision an Autonomous Database instance through the OCI console, API, or CLI.

### Management

The service manages all aspects of database operations, including patching, backups, and scaling.

### Access

Users can connect to the database using standard SQL and database tools. It supports a wide range of application development frameworks and integration options.
